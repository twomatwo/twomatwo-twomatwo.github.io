# The Paradox of Choices: Why More is Less

## All kinds of choices ruined my life

I have been facing all kinds of choices in my life. I won't be surprised if it turned out that half of my spare time was wasted struggling with choices. 

Even before writing this article, I was wondering hard whether I should write is on my notebook (which is handy and comfortable) or should write it directly into a markdown file (for storage and posting on my blog), whether to write in English (through which I can practise my English) or in Chinese (easier for others to read, write more fluently).

My web browser always have tons of tabs left open -- I couldn't bear turning them off. Whenever I met up with some funny ideas, cool projects or some so-called *important life advice*, I would think "maybe I should do that too" or "that's an idea worth recording" and left the tab in the browser for future processing. However, while the number of tabs on the browser is growing, my motivation to deal with them kept declining. So I always end up without reading any of them at last.

The same is true when I was trying to study. I spent lots of time searching on zhihu for *best physics textbooks*,  and even download several copies, but hardly ever open one of them and tackle with it. I spent lots of time looking for the best reading materials for English learning, but never use the material in the end. 

Basically, I spent most of my time making choices without arriving at the desired results.

## Why choices makes people miserable

In [the TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_the_paradox_of_choice/) presented by Barry Schwartz, he analyzed the following reasons why too many choices made people miserable.

### escalation of expectation

The reasons why we are struggling too much is that we all want to make *the best decision* . Since you are all aware of the pros and cons of different choices, so the only person who should take the responsibility is yourself. 

### paralysis rather than liberation

## Solution?

### No, there's doesn't exist the best decision.

Every choices have their own pros and cons, so there might not exist a "best choice" after all. Your decision will never be the perfect one, since there will always be other choices better than it in some ways. However, keep in mind that with few efforts, all gaps can be filled. 

### Making choices isn't everything.

In fact, making choices might just like choosing the path at the beginning of an adventure. Some path might be easier, and some might be more bumpier, but as long as you follow it till the end, you can always arrive at your destination. The scenery on the bumpier path might be more beautiful.

### The real task is to work head on.
